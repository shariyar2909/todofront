How long did you spend on your solution?
I think I spent around 4-5 hours including setup. 

• How do you build and run your solution? 
I Have a backend code with the running in the debug mode to access the api in front end. 

• What technical and functional assumptions did you make when implementing your solution? 
BackEnd
There is a get API and PUT API (which I not in use since I was not using DB I change the functionally in front end) There is unit testing not all coverage but yes for demonstarting. 
FrontEnd 
Get functinality Update functionality (status update) Added new Task

• If you were unable to complete any user stories, outline why and how would you have liked to implement them.
I have completed all the stories. If I had spent more time on this I would have added more testing. Would have also handled the error expection. Would have added more functionality.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
